Advanced Items
==============

Items can become quite complex since there are many interchangeable parts.
Between all of these parts there are countless possibilities for creating items and any other content for that matter.
However, since a great deal of content share can be grouped up there has been efforts made to mitigate repeating yourself.
Such as we all know that a sword is an item and is equippable and generally can be crafted so we have provided a 'Sword' template to make creating swords easier.
You can read about many of the :ref:`existing templates here <existing-templates>`.
It is even possible to :ref:`create new templates <creating-templates>`.
