Templates
==============

In programming, programmers divide their code into parts so they can reuse only certain parts
when they need it later. Sometimes these parts are related together and we want to group them 
further. In Crea this process is done using templates. Templates are used 
many things can become quite complex since there are many 
interchangeable parts.
This might sound confusing at first. However it is a really powerful pattern! In order to understand,
it further lets think about something common in Crea, items. 

Items can become quite complex since there are many interchangeable parts.
Between all of these parts there are countless possibilities for creating items and any other content for that matter.
However, since a great deal of content share can be grouped up there has been efforts made to mitigate repeating yourself.
Such as we all know that a sword is an item and is equippable and generally can be crafted so we have provided a 'Sword' template to make creating swords easier.
You can read about many of the :ref:`existing templates here <existing-templates>`.
It is even possible to :ref:`create new templates <creating-templates>`.
