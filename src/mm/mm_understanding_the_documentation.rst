Understanding the Documentation
================================

.. note::

    DO NOT PANIC! This we be as painless as possible! You will be creating mods in no time!

In order for this documentation to be useful, there are a couple of prequistes that need to be understood beforehand. The documentation is split into two parts:
basic and advanced. The basic sections should be understood with basic programming knowledge. However, the advanced sections will require a basic to intermediate understanding
of programming. 

Python
-------

The scripting language that Crea uses is called Python. In order to create a mod for Crea, there are a couple of things about Python that must be known.

.. note::

    Read all of these. Without reading all of them, they will not make sense!

The following topics must be understood for the BASIC documentation:
 * Variables and Datatypes https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/variables-datatypes
 * Functions https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/function
 * Classes https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/class
 * Statements, Indentation, and Comments https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/statement-indentation-comments

The following topics must be understood for ADVANCED documentation:
TODO!

Crea mods are created using the Python scripting language.

Next Steps

After learning the prequistes for the documentation, we now get to apply it!
